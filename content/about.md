I'm Abundance, I'm a random person and I do random stuff  
//say something cool about being a programmer  
what I really love tho is knowing stuff and talking about it  
also like to solve complex problems

# Stuff I know

- Computers. This probably goes without saying, but i think computers are really cool,  
  I enjoy learning about how computers work under the hood (
  you know, computer architecture and stuff)  
  I also try to build a few low level projects when i can InshAllah

- Rust. been learning this for some time, I try implementing some fairly complex projects every once in a while \
  you should check them out

- Machine Learning. specifically know a lot about deep learning (gotta prepare for our AI overlords)
  work mostly with Pytorch(I'm pretty good with python)

- Know lots of theory about random systems(mostly from ~~failed~~ developing projects) \
  notably there's TCP/IP(just network stuff in general), git internals and operating systems\
  -- this isn't really an exhaustive list

- Web Development - Kinda hate it but it pays i guess, mostly use React or Next for frontend (all in Typescript of course) and Express\
  FastApi/Flask or django for backend
  
  
# Other Stuff

- I read a lot of books on a lot of topics\
  mostly never finish them (curse my short attention span ðŸ˜­)

- I'm really into music \
  like reaaaaaally into music \
  literally catalog my memories by song \
  I like mostly pop, 80's, and chill indie stuff \
  but I'll listen to anything really

- I dabble in writing every once in a while(mostly when i'm really bored)

- interested in cooking(sort of suck at it for now ðŸ˜«)

# umm what else?

- favourite thing to do \
  read a book(fiction, alternative reality, mind fucking)\
  while listening to nice music and feeling happy with my life \
  not something i do very often tho

- A pretty close second is sharing fun moments with friends\
  (i've got really cool friends)

- I love to spend money \
