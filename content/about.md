<h2>I'm Abundance, I'm a random person and I do random stuff \
//say something cool about being a programmer
what I really love tho is knowing stuff and talking about it \
also like to solve complex problems \
\
\</h2>

<h1>Stuff I Know </h1>\
Rust -> been learning this for a while, I try implementing some fairly complex projects every once in a while \
you should check them out 

Machine Learning -> I specifically know a lot about deep learning (gotta prepare for our AI overlords)
work mostly with Pytorch(I'm pretty good with python) \
\
Know lots of theory about random systems(mostly from ~~failed~~ developing projects) \
notably there's TCP/IP(just network stuff in general), git internals and operating systems\
-- this isn't really an exhaustive list\
\
\
\
<h1>Other Stuff</h1>\
I read a lot of books on a lot of topics\
mostly never finish them (curse my short attention span)\
\
I'm really into music \
like reaaaaaally into music \
literally catalog my memories by song \
I like mostly pop, 80's, and chill indie stuff \
but I'll listen to anything really \
interested in cooking(sort of suck at it for now :tears)\
\
\
<h1>umm what else? </h1>\
favourite thing to do \
read a book(fiction, alternative reality, mind fucking)\
while listening to chill music and feeling happy with my life \
not something i do very often tho\
\
A pretty close second is sharing fun moments with friends\
(i've got really cool friends)\
\
I love to spend money \
send me money please :smile
