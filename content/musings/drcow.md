If only I wasn’t in this class\
I’d be out on the streets making cash\
I’d go on trips above and beyond\
With the ones I love, staying out in the sun\
But sadly I’m stuck in this room right now\
With my least favorite teacher in the world dr cow\
Here seconds pass by like they were years\
And the distinct murmuring aches my ears\
Maybe if I think about a life\
Or decide to end mine with a very sharp knife\
I’d at last be saved from harrowing hell\
Or at least find an excuse to stay in my cell\
Is it just me or does this class drive you mad\
It’s probably just the stomach ache making me sad\
Well , I guess that’s all for now\
Final words for my least favorite teacher Dr Cow
