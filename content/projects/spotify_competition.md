I've been thinking a lot recently about how most machine learning projects in production 
aren't just about getting that one classifier neural network or something like that to work  
it usually involves building intricately complex systems with different 
with different architectures that usually piece together to make something big and beautiful(for the most part)

A weird mistake a lot of ML practicioners(or at the very least just me ) make is that they tend to loose focus on the bigger picture 
and forget to make the things that would actually make their models functional ....




so in the light of getting better at solving problems end to end with machine learning 
I decided to implement an industry level(i'm probably being generous here) recommendation system

finding one to implement was pretty hard tbh 


at first i thought i'd try netflix
