(something about how you haven&rsquo;t done serious ML in a while and you decided to blitz through some GAN papers - maybe talk about how you want to colour manga using GANS (link to the paper) and how the paper didn&rsquo;t make any sense at first)</p><p>Before talking about GANS i think it&rsquo;d be cool to talk about how computer scientists frame the problem of generating (data?)</p><p>we look at sample data(thats the patterns we want to generate as probability distributions) across some domain</p><p>if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the term</p><p>&ndash; drop wikipedia? definition of probability distributions here</p><p>probability distributions are the way we represent the likelihood that some data sample will occur at a point(in some number space)</p><p>an example with the MNIST dataset(if you&rsquo;ve never heard of it it&rsquo;s a dataset of handwritten digits sized 28x28)</p><p>since each image is 28x28 pixels we&rsquo;ve got 784 (values?) for each image</p><p>say we represent that in a coordinate system with 784 dimensions(this isn&rsquo;t something people really do - if we needed to though we&rsquo;d need to use some sort of dimensionality reduction first)</p><p>we&rsquo;d have 784^(784) possible data points that could occur
but not every data point would be MNIST digits
in fact most of it would be noise</p><p>a probability distribution for MNIST basically gives us a value between 0 and 1 for each data point that represents how likely that point is to be a number, kinda like a description
all I&rsquo;d need to do to (generate)? numbers if i had this distribution
is take the data points with a high probability in the distribution</p><p>so in a way we can think of generating taking points from a probability distribution of the items we&rsquo;re trying to generate (that are not included in the training set that we used to somehow do this)</p><p>ok so we&rsquo;re hopefully up to speed..</p><p>Generative Adversarial Networks work by trying to make a new probability distribution that is as similar as possible to the intrinsic distribution of our training data</p><p>since all the information we have about this &ldquo;intrinsic&rdquo; distribution is its samples(our training data) you can also say GANs try to estimate a probability distribution(think a description for out ) from its observed samples</p></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2024 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
