but I&rsquo;m a Computer Engineering major</p><p>For a while i&rsquo;ve been a having lot of classes on circuit theory(I find it unnecesarily complex and annoying beyond reason -_-)
but one cool thing i&rsquo;ve noticed during class is that electrical circuits are a pretty fascinating system
with lots of simple rules that scale to form interesting patterns. Also, most of the moving pieces involved are very clearly defined and for most of circuit analysis we usually focus on ideals so there&rsquo;s very little undefined behaviour<br>(DISCLAIMER - this doesn&rsquo;t mean by any chance that I enjoy the subject in anyway
(I hope circuit theory burns ðŸ˜ ))</p><p>but it does seem like something that could be really nice to write a simulation for</p><p>now i&rsquo;m a pretty lazy person
and when i have a cool idea like this i usually just check for a decently good implementation of it and see if i understand at least some of what they did
or at the very least look for a specification and just implement that for sport or something.<br>I checked, and a lot of the solutions out there were like high up professional grade stuff that my brain was too small to fathom
and they didn&rsquo;t really cover the use case i&rsquo;m looking for (doing my homework :hehe)
so this time I figured I&rsquo;d implement it myself(hopefully this isn&rsquo;t a big waste of time)</p><p>The first thing I had to figure out was how to represent an electric ciruit with text and verify that the circuits are valid
(and build a simple interpeter for whatever I came up with)
tbh at the start of this I had absolutely no intention of figuring that out on my own because it honestly seemed like a looooot of work
(me no like work)
but it was suprisingly shocking how little effort had been put towards solving that basic problem(text representation for circuits)
even after expert googling(trust me i tried)
I only found one random ass electronic stack exchange where the question was asked
and all the guys that replied pointed out this thing called a SPICE netlist
looks a little like this<figure class=center><img src=/img/splice.jpg style=border-radius:8px></figure></p><p>I checked the syntax and honestly i&rsquo;ll probably figure out a cure to cancer before i build anything to interpret that mess<br>(a more constructive argument would be that i think it focused way to much on circuit connections in practice and not the conceptual thing so it seems more like instructions for patching a circuit than a representation and that&rsquo;s not really what i&rsquo;m going for<br>That and it looks like it was made in the 70&rsquo;s
)</p><p>anyways as you probably guessed by now
i was on my own
and it was time to put on my big brain hat and figure this out
i got my sad indie playlist queued up (dont judge me)
and got to work</p><p>It took a few minutes(and consulting a friend)
to figure out a working model for the circuit</p><p>first for the syntax I went with the easier handsoff approach
the circuit componenets are represented based on how they would be connected on an &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; <a href=%22https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all%22>breadboard</a></p><figure class=center><img src=/img/breadboard.jpeg style=border-radius:8px></figure><p>the holes on the breadboard are points where the electrical components are to be connected to
and its basically a grid so a 2 -coordinate index can be used to identify each hole</p><p>each line on the breadboard represents a node and it&rsquo;s a way of connecting multiple components to the same point(ie every component on the same line are connected to the same point)</p><p>so circuit representation &mldr;&mldr;<br>a circuit is a list of connections(sequence doesn&rsquo;t matter since this is descriptive) seperated by dots(meh why not)</p><p>to declare a connection all you need to is state the label for the component being connected, then it&rsquo;s terminal ie + or - and then the hole where it would be connected to on the breadboard grid
since we dont have that many components involved (at least for now ) each component can be represented with a single letter and the type can just add a count for reference each unique component in the label
for now i think i&rsquo;ll go with P for power source and R for resistor
so P1 means the first power source</p><p>we end up with something like this</p><p>P+01 -> (the positive terminal of the power source is plugged in at the 01 hole )</p><p>lets try representing a complete circuit for sport</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Check out my other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=https://abundance-io.github.io/posts/featuresarecool/><span class=button__text></span>
