&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d just finished evening lessons and I had to go back home, it was the same old routine, I&amp;rsquo;d done this for about three years, pick my little sister and take the A11 bus back home on the way back we&amp;rsquo;d meet Brad, he&amp;rsquo;s this guy from the prep school next to mine that I&amp;rsquo;ve been dating
for a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s really nice and I enjoy talking with him. we&amp;rsquo;d get to the crossing and my sister would beg for me to let her cross the road alone because she was 9 now and a big girl and everyday I&amp;rsquo;d say
&amp;ldquo;absolutely not&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That day was different
She does the weird cute eyes thing. I really love those tiny eyes. Brad joins her too. I look at the road and it seems pretty ok, what&amp;rsquo;s the worst that could happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tell her she can go but to be careful and that it was a one-time thing, mom would kill me if she found out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She darts across the road and I instantly realize what&amp;rsquo;s about to happen. I drop my bag and sprint after her, Brad runs after me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I trip and fall
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
FLASH
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
I think I jammed my knee, I can&amp;rsquo;t get up, I hear the brakes on the truck screech and people around are screaming
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
FLASH
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
I think the truck just made impact. I hear the soft screeching of human flesh against the tarmac. She probably got caught under the bumper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brad runs toward the truck
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
FLASH
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
I see the blood trail her body leaves, I have to get up, I have to help her, she has to be ok, I try to pry myself up on my other leg but i fall again
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
FLASH
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
My head hits hard on the road, Brad is back at my side, what is he doing here, why isn&amp;rsquo;t he helping her. I lose consciousness as the effect of the hit starts to sink.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I slip into the darkness I realize what had just happened, what I&amp;rsquo;d just done&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had killed my sister&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wake up on a hospital bed, I must have been out for a few hours. My mother is sitting next to me, her eyes are swollen red, she&amp;rsquo;s definetely
been crying, she holds my hand and says&lt;/p>
&lt;p>it&amp;rsquo;ll be ok. I already know the bad news. my sister was gone, she was gone forever, I&amp;rsquo;d never see her again
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
Except she was right there&lt;/p>
&lt;p>standing at the foot of the bed, her clothes were ripped and bloodied from the road, and her left side had been completely mangled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One arm had been completely severed, and her left eye socket was an
empty, gaping hole. Her skin was covered in deep cuts and abrasions, and dried blood and grime filled the hollows of her face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She looked at me with her one remaining eye, her face contorted in pain, and said the words that have echoed in my mind ever since: &amp;ldquo;You did this to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been 13 years since then, I&amp;rsquo;m 29 now and my sister still hasn&amp;rsquo;t left, she&amp;rsquo;s always there, standing across from me while I eat, taking the same cab rides as me, sitting on the road at the spot where she
died each time saying the all too familiar words &amp;ldquo;you did this to me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wonder why she still bothers with that. I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t need anyone to remind me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I blame myself every day. I wish I&amp;rsquo;d gone instead of her, I wish I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen to Brad. That all doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter now does it?
none of it matters anymore&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been to a few doctors since the incident and I&amp;rsquo;ve been diagnosed with a lot of things, PTSD&amp;rsquo;s at the top of the list, recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing this therapist who thinks we can work out my problems and that life can go back to &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I told her about how my sister keeps me company and she says it would be great if I took meds to help with my &amp;ldquo;hallucinations&amp;rdquo; because &amp;ldquo;getting rid of them is a very important thing for my healing
process&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thing is, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to feel better, I dont want to forget, I need to remember every day, every second, what I did to her, how I killed her. I can never forget, I must never forget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s 2:00am in the morning and it&amp;rsquo;s a little chilly, I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking to my sister pretty often for the past few days. She&amp;rsquo;s come up with the perfect plan to make me pay for my actions and today is the
day we we&amp;rsquo;re doing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve got my rope and the conveniently placed ceiling fan in my
bedroom all ready to go â€“ hanging, how cliche.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s actually one of the more painless ways to die, once you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten past all the choking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tighten the noose around my neck and the hook of the fan while my sister smiles behind me urging me on, I&amp;rsquo;m glad I can finally make her happy, glad I can finally atone for my sin. I signal to her that I&amp;rsquo;m ready, she nods and kicks the chair under me&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I fall and well&amp;hellip;
you know the rest&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Simulating Electric Circuits</title><link>https://abundance-io.github.io/posts/simulatingcircuits/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 10:57:12 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://abundance-io.github.io/posts/simulatingcircuits/</guid><description>You probably didn&amp;rsquo;t know this but I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer Engineering major

&lt;p>For a while i&amp;rsquo;ve been a having lot of classes on circuit theory(I find it unnecesarily complex and annoying beyond reason -_-)
but one cool thing i&amp;rsquo;ve noticed during class is that electrical circuits are a pretty fascinating system

&lt;p>Also, most of the moving pieces involved are very clearly defined and for most of circuit analysis we usually focus on ideals so there&amp;rsquo;s very little undefined behaviour&lt;br>
(DISCLAIMER - this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean by any chance that I enjoy the subject in anyway
(I hope circuit theory burns ðŸ˜ ))&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but it does seem like something that could be really nice to write a simulation for&lt;/p>
&lt;p>now i&amp;rsquo;m a pretty lazy person
and when i have a cool idea like this i usually just check for a decently good implementation of it and see if i understand at least some of what they did
or at the very least look for a specification and just implement that for sport or something.&lt;br>
I checked, and a lot of the solutions out there were like high up professional grade stuff that my brain was too small to fathom
and they didn&amp;rsquo;t really cover the use case i&amp;rsquo;m looking for (doing my homework :hehe)
so this time I figured I&amp;rsquo;d implement it myself(hopefully this isn&amp;rsquo;t a big waste of time)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I had to figure out was how to represent an electric ciruit with text and verify that the circuits are valid
(and build a simple interpeter for whatever I came up with)
tbh at the start of this I had absolutely no intention of figuring that out on my own because it honestly seemed like a looooot of work
(me no like work)
but it was suprisingly shocking how little effort had been put towards solving that basic problem(text representation for circuits)
even after expert googling(trust me i tried)
I only found one random ass electronic stack exchange where the question was asked
and all the guys that replied pointed out this thing called a SPICE netlist
looks a little like this
&lt;figure class="center" >
&lt;img src="https://abundance-io.github.io/img/splice.jpg" style="border-radius: 8px;" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I checked the syntax and honestly i&amp;rsquo;ll probably figure out a cure to cancer before i build anything to interpret that mess&lt;br>
(a more constructive argument would be that i think it focused way to much on circuit connections in practice and not the conceptual thing so it seems more like instructions for patching a circuit than a representation and that&amp;rsquo;s not really what i&amp;rsquo;m going for&lt;br>
That and it looks like it was made in the 70&amp;rsquo;s
)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>anyways as you probably guessed by now
i was on my own
and it was time to put on my big brain hat and figure this out
i got my sad indie playlist queued up (dont judge me)
and got to work&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took a few minutes(and consulting a friend)
to figure out a working model for the circuit&lt;/p>
&lt;p>first for the syntax I went with the easier handsoff approach
the circuit components are represented based on how they would be connected on an &amp;ldquo;infinite&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="%22https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all%22">breadboard&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center" >
&lt;img src="https://abundance-io.github.io/img/breadboard.jpeg" style="border-radius: 8px;" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>the holes on the breadboard are points where the electrical components are to be connected to
and its basically a grid so a 2 -coordinate index can be used to identify each hole&lt;/p>
&lt;p>each line on the breadboard represents a node and it&amp;rsquo;s a way of connecting multiple components to the same point(ie every component on the same line are connected to the same point)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so circuit representation &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
a circuit is a list of connections(sequence doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter since this is descriptive) seperated by dots(meh why not)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to declare a connection all you need to is state the label for the component being connected, then it&amp;rsquo;s terminal ie + or - and then the hole where it would be connected to on the breadboard grid.&lt;br>
since we dont have that many components involved (at least for now ) each component can be represented with a single letter and we can just add a count to reference each unique component for the label
for now i think i&amp;rsquo;ll go with P for power source and R for resistor
so P1 means the first power source&lt;/p>
&lt;p>we end up with something like this&lt;/p>
&lt;p>P1+01 -&amp;gt; (the positive terminal of the power source is plugged in at the 01 hole )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>here&amp;rsquo;s what a complete circuit would look like&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;br>
(conceptual diagam above, breadboard patch below)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>this would be represented as&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="p101r102r203p1-31r1-32r2-33">P1+01.R1+02.R2+03.P1-31.R1-32.R2-33&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>(remember this is purely descriptive so any order would still work)
(note that i&amp;rsquo;m starting the count from the third row(in relation to the diagram) so row no 3 has index 0 and so on&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
