I’d be out on the streets making cash
I’d go on trips above and beyond
With the ones I love, staying out in the sun
But sadly I’m stuck in this room right now
With my least favorite teacher in the world dr cow
Here seconds pass by like they were years
And the distinct murmuring aches my ears
Maybe if I think about a life
Or decide to end mine with a very sharp knife
I’d at last be saved from harrowing hell
Or at least find an excuse to stay in my cell
Is it just me or does this class drive you mad
It’s probably just the stomach ache making me sad
Well , I guess that’s all for now
Final words for my least favorite teacher Dr Cow&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
