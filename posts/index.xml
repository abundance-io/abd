For a while i&amp;rsquo;ve been a having lot of classes on circuit theory(I find it unnecesarily complex and annoying beyond reason -_-) but one cool thing i&amp;rsquo;ve noticed during class is that electrical circuits are a pretty fascinating system with lots of simple rules that scale to form interesting patterns.
Also, most of the moving pieces involved are very clearly defined and for most of circuit analysis we usually focus on ideals so there&amp;rsquo;s very little undefined behaviour</description></item></channel></rss>
