I’d be out on the streets making cash&lt;br>
I’d go on trips above and beyond&lt;br>
With the ones I love, staying out in the sun&lt;br>
But sadly I’m stuck in this room right now&lt;br>
With my least favorite teacher in the world dr cow&lt;br>
Here seconds pass by like they were years&lt;br>
And the distinct murmuring aches my ears&lt;br>
Maybe if I think about a life&lt;br>
Or decide to end mine with a very sharp knife&lt;br>
I’d at last be saved from harrowing hell&lt;br>
Or at least find an excuse to stay in my cell&lt;br>
Is it just me or does this class drive you mad&lt;br>
It’s probably just the stomach ache making me sad&lt;br>
Well , I guess that’s all for now&lt;br>
Final words for my least favorite teacher Dr Cow&lt;/p></content></item><item><title/><link>https://abundance-io.github.io/posts/featuresarecool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance-io.github.io/posts/featuresarecool/</guid><description/><content/></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://abundance-io.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance-io.github.io/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m Abundance, I&amp;rsquo;m a random person and I do random stuff
//say something cool about being a programmer
what I really love tho is knowing stuff and talking about it
also like to solve complex problems
Stuff I know Rust -&amp;gt; been learning this for a while, I try implementing some fairly complex projects every once in a while you should check them out
Machine Learning -&amp;gt; specifically know a lot about deep learning (gotta prepare for our AI overlords) work mostly with Pytorch(I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good with python)</description><content>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m Abundance, I&amp;rsquo;m a random person and I do random stuff&lt;br>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Machine Learning -&amp;gt; specifically know a lot about deep learning (gotta prepare for our AI overlords)
work mostly with Pytorch(I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good with python)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Know lots of theory about random systems(mostly from &lt;del>failed&lt;/del> developing projects) &lt;br>
notably there&amp;rsquo;s TCP/IP(just network stuff in general), git internals and operating systems&lt;br>
&amp;ndash; this isn&amp;rsquo;t really an exhaustive list&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="other-stuff">Other Stuff&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I read a lot of books on a lot of topics&lt;br>
mostly never finish them (curse my short attention span)\&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m really into music &lt;br>
like reaaaaaally into music &lt;br>
literally catalog my memories by song &lt;br>
I like mostly pop, 80&amp;rsquo;s, and chill indie stuff &lt;br>
but I&amp;rsquo;ll listen to anything really \&lt;/li>
&lt;li>interested in cooking(sort of suck at it for now :tears)\&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="umm-what-else">umm what else?#&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>favourite thing to do &lt;br>
read a book(fiction, alternative reality, mind fucking)&lt;br>
while listening to chill music and feeling happy with my life &lt;br>
not something i do very often tho\&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A pretty close second is sharing fun moments with friends&lt;br>
(i&amp;rsquo;ve got really cool friends)\&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>on GitHub. please dont judge me&lt;/li>
&lt;li>on Twitter. I never post :)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Email me &lt;a href="mailto:abundanceanyanwu@gmail.com">abundanceanyanwu@gmail.com&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably respond in a few years(except you&amp;rsquo;re a potential employer
then consider me responded)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discord&lt;/li>
