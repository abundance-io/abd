I’d be out on the streets making cash
I’d go on trips above and beyond
With the ones I love, staying out in the sun
But sadly I’m stuck in this room right now
With my least favorite teacher in the world dr cow
Here seconds pass by like they were years
And the distinct murmuring aches my ears

I’d be out on the streets making cash&lt;br>
I’d go on trips above and beyond&lt;br>
With the ones I love, staying out in the sun&lt;br>
But sadly I’m stuck in this room right now&lt;br>
With my least favorite teacher in the world dr cow&lt;br>
Here seconds pass by like they were years&lt;br>
And the distinct murmuring aches my ears&lt;br>
Maybe if I think about a life&lt;br>
Or decide to end mine with a very sharp knife&lt;br>
I’d at last be saved from harrowing hell&lt;br>
Or at least find an excuse to stay in my cell&lt;br>
Is it just me or does this class drive you mad&lt;br>
It’s probably just the stomach ache making me sad&lt;br>
Well , I guess that’s all for now&lt;br>
Final words for my least favorite teacher Dr Cow&lt;/p></content></item><item><title/><link>https://abundance-io.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance-io.github.io/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m Abundance, I&amp;rsquo;m a random person and I do random stuff I sort of like programming what I really love tho is knowing stuff and talking about it also like to solve complex problems

&lt;p>Stuff I Know
Rust -&amp;gt; been learning this for a while, I try implementing some fairly complex projects every once in a while
you should check them out&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Machine Learning -&amp;gt; I specifically know a lot about deep learning (gotta prepare for our AI overlords)
work mostly with Pytorch(I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good with python)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Know lots of theory about random systems(mostly from &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->failed&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> developing projects)
notably there&amp;rsquo;s TCP/IP(just network stuff in general), git internals and operating systems
&amp;ndash; this isn&amp;rsquo;t really an exhaustive list&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other Stuff
I read a lot of books on a lot of topics
mostly never finish them (curse my short attention span)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m really into music
like reaaaaaally into music
literally catalog my memories by song
I like mostly pop, 80&amp;rsquo;s, and chill indie stuff
but I&amp;rsquo;ll listen to anything really
interested in cooking(sort of suck at it for now :tears)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>umm what else?
favourite thing to do
read a book(fiction, alternative reality, mind fucking)
while listening to chill music and feeling happy with my life
not something i do very often tho&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A pretty close second is sharing fun moments with friends
(i&amp;rsquo;ve got really cool friends)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love to spend money
send me money please :smile&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Find me
on GitHub. please dont judge me
on Twitter. I never post :)

then consider me responded)
