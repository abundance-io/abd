I’d be out on the streets making cash
I’d go on trips above and beyond

I’d be out on the streets making cash&lt;br>
I’d go on trips above and beyond&lt;br>
With the ones I love, staying out in the sun&lt;br>
But sadly I’m stuck in this room right now&lt;br>
With my least favorite teacher in the world dr cow&lt;br>
Here seconds pass by like they were years&lt;br>
And the distinct murmuring aches my ears&lt;br>
Maybe if I think about a life&lt;br>
Or decide to end mine with a very sharp knife&lt;br>
I’d at last be saved from harrowing hell&lt;br>
Or at least find an excuse to stay in my cell&lt;br>
Is it just me or does this class drive you mad&lt;br>
It’s probably just the stomach ache making me sad&lt;br>
Well , I guess that’s all for now&lt;br>
Final words for my least favorite teacher Dr Cow&lt;/p></content></item><item><title/><link>https://abundance-io.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance-io.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hey There
