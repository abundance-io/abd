      <title>To Feel</title>

      <description>When it first got out that I cut myself, the question I got asked the most was why. My parents, my friends—none of them could understand it. Why would you do something that physically harmed you over and over? Didn’t you feel the pain? Well, of course it hurts. That’s why I do it. I do it because sometimes it seems like pain is the only way I can feel anything.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;When it first got out that I cut myself, the question I got asked the most was why. My parents, my friends—none of them could understand it. Why would you do something that physically harmed you over and over? Didn’t you feel the pain? Well, of course it hurts. That’s why I do it. I do it because sometimes it seems like pain is the only way I can feel anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is feeling anyway? It’s this random thing that we take for granted. We all just feel feelings, and that’s that. Happy, angry, bored. The feelings we feel are what make life worth living. We experience a lot of things in life, but it&amp;rsquo;s usually the emotions attached to those things that we remember most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I haven’t been able to feel anything. The things that made me happy or upset, the feeling of love, of joy—just everything. It’s all been replaced with numbness, like this empty feeling. I guess emptiness is a feeling in its own way. Maybe that’s a bit of a consolation. I’m not a psychopath or anything. I know when to laugh or smile, and I’m pretty good with consoling people when they’re sad. I guess if you knew me personally, you probably wouldn’t notice. Most people around me didn’t, anyways—that is, until they saw the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tell people I feel numb, they always ask what caused it, or maybe who. And the thing is, I don’t really know. I just started waking up each morning feeling a little down, and it got worse and worse until we got here. In some ways, I cut to give my problems meaning. If I’m a normal guy with okay parents and decent friends feeling down, then it’s not really that big of a deal. But if I’m the guy who, despite seeming okay, was going through something so terrible inside that it caused him to hurt himself—then the problems become real. Cutting helped me feel like what I was going through was real in a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the last question I get asked is why pain. Why did I, for some reason, feel like pain was the only thing I was capable of feeling? Well, it’s because pain is pretty straightforward. Our bodies always feel it. A knife cut will hurt like a bitch whether you’re depressed or the happiest person alive. There’s a kind of certainty to it, it’s comforting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Evo Part 1</title>

      <description>A few months ago, I saw this really cool YouTube video demonstrating a simulation of evolution through natural selection, and it blew my mind. As such, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a good idea to try and recreate the system, and here we are. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since I decided to do this, and there have been a lot of weird hitches and changes. But I eventually reached a decent point in the project and thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a good idea to write about it.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I saw this really cool &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk&amp;t=1366s&#34;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating a simulation of evolution through natural selection, and it blew my mind. As such, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a good idea to try and recreate the system, and here we are. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since I decided to do this, and there have been a lot of weird hitches and changes. But I eventually reached a decent point in the project and thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a good idea to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-is-evo&#34;&gt;So&amp;hellip; What is Evo?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evo is a system that simulates natural selection. Well, what is natural selection? It&amp;rsquo;s basically a process where organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce, passing on favorable traits to their offspring. Over generations, this leads to the evolution of populations.&lt;br&gt;
The point of Evo is to try to replicate this digitally, creating a small world where &amp;ldquo;digital organisms&amp;rdquo; evolve to adapt to their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neural network for each organism is encoded as a &amp;ldquo;genome,&amp;rdquo; which is just a string representation of the network’s structure and weights. Analogous to biology, the genome defines the organism&amp;rsquo;s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simulate natural selection, you need organisms. The way we represent the organisms in this system is with a simple neural net.&lt;br&gt;
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of those, a neural net is a system inspired by the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make organisms from neural nets, we implement them such that the input neurons take in information from the organism&amp;rsquo;s environment (basically its senses), and the output neurons cause the organism to perform an action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A string representation of this neural net is called a genome (like in biology), and it completely represents the behavior patterns of the organism. To keep things analogous with biology, a gene in this system is just a connection between neurons in the neural net. This allows us to say that genomes are made of genes, just like we would in biological organisms. Also, because it&amp;rsquo;s not really practical to read through lines of genomes for the organisms in our simulation, we represent each genome as a color such that similar genomes (i.e., similar behavior) are represented with similar colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;re mostly up to speed with how the organisms would work, how would natural selection work in this system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, natural selection is something that occurs over generations, so these organisms would have to reproduce in some way and eventually die off.&lt;br&gt;
Next, the only reason natural selection occurs is that there&amp;rsquo;s some adversity in the system that causes some organisms to die and others to live depending on how they behave.&lt;br&gt;
In this system, the adversity is just having live and die zones in the simulation—basically, parts of the environment where if the organism gets to them, they&amp;rsquo;d live, and if they don&amp;rsquo;t, they&amp;rsquo;d die.&lt;br&gt;
The organisms that don&amp;rsquo;t die get to reproduce sexually. The way this works is that two organisms are selected at random from the environment, and parts of their genomes are combined to create a new genome representing a new organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope with this experiment (well, it&amp;rsquo;s more of the expected result because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it work already) is that by killing off the &amp;ldquo;unfit&amp;rdquo; organisms and allowing the more &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; ones to reproduce, we create a pool of organisms whose genetics allow them to easily survive in the environment. And that is called&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;drumroll&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-am-i-building-evo&#34;&gt;How am I building Evo?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m writing it completely in Rust. For the graphics, I initially started using SDL2 but then switched to Bevy (I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write more about why later). I&amp;rsquo;ll add more implementation details as I write more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I wish I could remember like it was yesterday, all I really remember are flashes, flashes of the most horrible moments of my life.
I&amp;rsquo;d just finished evening lessons and I had to go back home, it was the same old routine, I&amp;rsquo;d done this for about three years, pick my little sister and take the A11 bus back home .On the way back we&amp;rsquo;d meet Brad, he&amp;rsquo;s this guy from the prep school next to mine that I&amp;rsquo;ve been dating for a while.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I wish I could remember like it was yesterday, all I really remember are flashes, flashes of the most horrible moments of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d just finished evening lessons and I had to go back home, it was the same old routine, I&amp;rsquo;d done this for about three years, pick my little sister and take the A11 bus back home .On the way back we&amp;rsquo;d meet Brad, he&amp;rsquo;s this guy from the prep school next to mine that I&amp;rsquo;ve been dating
for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s really nice and I enjoy talking with him. we&amp;rsquo;d get to the crossing and my sister would beg for me to let her cross the road alone because she was 9 now and a big girl and everyday I&amp;rsquo;d say
&amp;ldquo;absolutely not&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day was different
She does the weird cute eyes thing. I really love those tiny eyes. Brad joins her too. I look at the road and it seems pretty ok, what&amp;rsquo;s the worst that could happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell her she can go but to be careful and that it was a one-time thing, mom would kill me if she found out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She darts across the road and I instantly realize what&amp;rsquo;s about to happen. I drop my bag and sprint after her, Brad runs after me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I trip and fall
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
FLASH
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think I jammed my knee, I can&amp;rsquo;t get up, I hear the brakes on the truck screech and people around are screaming
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
FLASH
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think the truck just made impact. I hear the soft screeching of human flesh against the tarmac. She probably got caught under the bumper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad runs toward the truck
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
FLASH
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I see the blood trail her body leaves, I have to get up, I have to help her, she has to be ok, I try to pry myself up on my other leg but i fall again
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
FLASH
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My head hits hard on the road, Brad is back at my side, what is he doing here, why isn&amp;rsquo;t he helping her. I lose consciousness as the effect of the hit starts to sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I slip into the darkness I realize what had just happened, what I&amp;rsquo;d just done&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had killed my sister&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up on a hospital bed, I must have been out for a few hours. My mother is sitting next to me, her eyes are swollen red, she&amp;rsquo;s definetely
been crying, she holds my hand and says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;ll be ok. I already know the bad news. my sister was gone, she was gone forever, I&amp;rsquo;d never see her again
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Except she was right there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;standing at the foot of the bed, her clothes were ripped and bloodied from the road, and her left side had been completely mangled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One arm had been completely severed, and her left eye socket was an
empty, gaping hole. Her skin was covered in deep cuts and abrasions, and dried blood and grime filled the hollows of her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked at me with her one remaining eye, her face contorted in pain, and said the words that have echoed in my mind ever since: &amp;ldquo;You did this to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been 13 years since then, I&amp;rsquo;m 29 now and my sister still hasn&amp;rsquo;t left, she&amp;rsquo;s always there, standing across from me while I eat, taking the same cab rides as me, sitting on the road at the spot where she
died each time saying the all too familiar words &amp;ldquo;you did this to me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder why she still bothers with that. I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t need anyone to remind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blame myself every day. I wish I&amp;rsquo;d gone instead of her, I wish I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen to Brad. That all doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter now does it?
none of it matters anymore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been to a few doctors since the incident and I&amp;rsquo;ve been diagnosed with a lot of things, PTSD&amp;rsquo;s at the top of the list, recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing this therapist who thinks we can work out my problems and that life can go back to &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told her about how my sister keeps me company and she says it would be great if I took meds to help with my &amp;ldquo;hallucinations&amp;rdquo; because &amp;ldquo;getting rid of them is a very important thing for my healing
process&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to feel better, I dont want to forget, I need to remember every day, every second, what I did to her, how I killed her. I can never forget, I must never forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 2:00am in the morning and it&amp;rsquo;s a little chilly, I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking to my sister pretty often for the past few days. She&amp;rsquo;s come up with the perfect plan to make me pay for my actions and today is the
day we we&amp;rsquo;re doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got my rope and the conveniently placed ceiling fan in my
bedroom all ready to go – hanging, how cliche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s actually one of the more painless ways to die, once you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten past all the choking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tighten the noose around my neck and the hook of the fan while my sister smiles behind me urging me on, I&amp;rsquo;m glad I can finally make her happy, glad I can finally atone for my sin. I signal to her that I&amp;rsquo;m ready, she nods and kicks the chair under me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fall and well&amp;hellip;
you know the rest&lt;/p&gt;
