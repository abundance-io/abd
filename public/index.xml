      <description>I wish I could remember like it was yesterday, all I really remember are flashes, flashes of the most horrible moments of my life.
I&amp;rsquo;d just finished evening lessons and I had to go back home, it was the same old routine, I&amp;rsquo;d done this for about three years, pick my little sister and take the A11 bus back home .On the way back we&amp;rsquo;d meet Brad, he&amp;rsquo;s this guy from the prep school next to mine that I&amp;rsquo;ve been datin for a while.</description>

      <description>Certainly, I can help you correct the grammatical errors in your text:
It&amp;rsquo;s pretty late, and I&amp;rsquo;m typing on my old tactile switch keyboard while thinking (well, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking) about my future. I feel like my perspective on my ideal future has changed a lot since I started school (which is crazy, considering it has only been a bit more than two years).
What I first pictured for myself was the life of a successful entrepreneur with lots of control, money, and influence.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot recently about how most machine learning projects in production aren&amp;rsquo;t just about getting that one classifier neural network or something like that to work
it usually involves building intricately complex systems with different with different architectures that usually piece together to make something big and beautiful(for the most part)
A weird mistake a lot of ML practicioners(or at the very least just me ) make is that they tend to loose focus on the bigger picture and forget to make the things that would actually make their models functional &amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>If only I wasn’t in this class
I’d be out on the streets making cash
I’d go on trips above and beyond
With the ones I love, staying out in the sun
But sadly I’m stuck in this room right now
With my least favorite teacher in the world dr cow
Here seconds pass by like they were years
And the distinct murmuring aches my ears
Maybe if I think about a life</description>

      <description>the initial model for candidate selection was WRMF(weight regularized matrix factorization)
from the name its pretty easy to assume what it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be doing
basically matrix factorization as used in regular collaborative filtering problems
where the userxitem ie preferences/ratings or whatever floats your boat is factorized into user and item embeddings that can be used for subsequent predictions
I think the regularization employed here is just for more efficiently learning (something i think is pretty relevant in this case since we&amp;rsquo;ve got like 20k&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Abundance, I&amp;rsquo;m a random person and I do random stuff
//say something cool about being a programmer
what I really love tho is knowing stuff and talking about it
also like to solve complex problems
Stuff I know Computers. This probably goes without saying, but i think computers are really cool,
I enjoy learning about how computers work under the hood ( you know, computer architecture and stuff)
I also try to build a few low level projects when i can InshAllah</description>
