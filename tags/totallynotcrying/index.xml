and thinking(well i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking) about my future I feel like my perspective on what the future holds for me and my ideal future have changed a lot since I got to school (which is crazy considering it has just been a bit more than two years)
what I first pictured for myself was the living-it-big entrepreneur with lots of control, money, and influence, all I needed to do was to be extremely good at what I do (which happens to be programming) get a really great job first then build a startup which blows up, makes me a lot of money, becomes a big business that gives me influence, I get to do the things I want with maximum freedom and live my life without monetary limits, et cetera et cetera.</description></item></channel></rss>
